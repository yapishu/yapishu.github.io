          <h3>infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            Provisioning and managing cloud Kubernetes infrastructure, declarative IaC gitops, CI/CD, monitoring, and scaleable systems. Experienced with AWS and GCP, but I prefer to run things myself. I can design that deployment.

        <li class="flow">
          <h3>software</h3>
          <p>
            Experienced writing bespoke web application backends and internal tooling & automations with a preference for Golang, as well as experience developing modern JS web application frameworks like Vue and Svelte. I can implement that feature.

        <li class="flow">
          <h3>hardware</h3>
          <p>
            Designing and deploying colocated or on-prem hardware configurations, including networking, storage, and compute. I can build that rack.

          <h3>digital freedom</h3>
          <p>
            My interests and preferences center around tools that augment individual agency; in particular, I have spent several years focused on building on and with <a href="https://urbit.org">Urbit</a>, a novel computer architecture and software stack designed to enable data ownership and computational self-sovereignty. I can learn that system.
